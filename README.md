# @psse-cpu/fixed-size-array

### :warning: :warning: Might contains bugs, do not use

JS/TS package to emulate fixed-size arrays from C/C++/Java and even Dart.  
Only used in SE-1222 (Data Structures) exercises.  Not for production use.

### Why?

The goal is to ue only one language for the newest batch Yechezkel, JS/TS, 
allow them to master one, and just switch later on as needed.

Unfortunately, JS has no fixed-size array, and to create data structures from
scratch (especially array lists), this package is provided.

### TODO

- more tests
- ESLint
- Prettier
- `FixedSizeArray.from`
